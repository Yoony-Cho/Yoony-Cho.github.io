## What is a variable?

> A variable is either the memory location itself or the name assigned to identify that memory location, used to store a single value.

To store multiple values using variables, one needs to use multiple variables as a mechanism to store a single value. However, using data structures such as arrays or objects, multiple values can be grouped together and used as a single value.

```js:tailwind.config.js
var name1 = value1
let name2 = value2
const name3 = value3

//객체나 배열 같은 자료구조를 사용하면 여러 개의 값을 하나로 그룹화하여 사용 가능
var user = {id: 1, name: 'Cho', age: '28'}

var users = [
  {id: 1, name: 'Cho', age: '28'},
  {id: 1, name: 'Yoony', age: '28'}
]
```

## Why should we use variables?

> To find the reason for using variables, you need to know the structure and operating principle of memory.

### Memory

Memory is a collection of memory cells that can store data. The size of each cell is '1 byte', and the computer reads or writes data in units of 1 byte. Each cell has a unique memory address, which is represented by an integer from 0 to the size of the memory.

To use or reuse data, one needs to access memory to retrieve the value. However, directly accessing memory through its address can cause fatal errors. To solve this problem, programming languages store the value to be remembered in memory and assign a name to the memory space using a variable to identify it for later use.

Variables are substituted with the memory space address by the compiler or interpreter and executed.

## Variable declaration

There are two essential steps to using a variable.

> 1. declaration (선언 단계)
> 2. initialization (초기화 단계)

Variable declaration refers to creating a variable, while initialization, which is one of the features of JavaScript, refers to assigning the initial value (undefined) to the declared variable.

## Declaration keyword

When declaring a variable, one must use the keywords var, let, or const.
Before let and const were introduced in ES6, only var was used to declare variables.
The three keywords, var, let, and const, have their own differences.

`var`

- Duplicate declarations and reallocation of values are possible.
- It supports function-level scopes, resulting in unintentional global variable declarations.

`let`

- Duplicate declaration is not possible, but reallocation of values is possible.

`const`

- Neither duplicate declarations nor reallocation of values are possible.

For this reason, const is used to declare constants whose values do not change, while var and let are used to declare variables whose values may change.
